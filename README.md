# Quizler Server Rewrite - Kotlin Spring

This project is a rewrite of the Quizler server using **Kotlin** and **Spring Framework**. The goal is to modernize the existing server and gain hands-on experience with Kotlin and Spring as core technologies for backend development.

## Objectives
- Rewrite the existing server in Kotlin.
- Use Spring Boot to create a clean and efficient REST API.
- Focus on simplicity and learning during the development process.

## Features
- Manage quizzes (create, update, delete).
- Provide a REST API for client applications.
- Use **H2 database** to manage hardcoded data during development.
- Gradle is used as the build tool.

## Notes
- Authentication and user management are **not included** in this stage to focus on core functionalities and experimentation.
- The database structure and persistence will evolve as the project progresses.

## Technologies
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: H2 (for development)
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
